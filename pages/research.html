        Weighted probability of job loss through computerisation and automation
        in local government areas of Australia.
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>This work is a qualitative study into the susceptibility of jobs in Australia
to computerisation and automation over the next 10 to 15 years. The methodology
and initial data used is based on the much-cited paper by Frey and Osborne,
which studied this same problem for the United States (<span class="caps">US</span>) and, more recently,
for the United Kingdom (<span class="caps">UK</span>). The key to this work is trying to understand and
quantify the impact of emerging technology on jobs and employment in areas such
as artificial intelligence, robotics and machine&nbsp;learning.</p>
<p>The results show that 40 per cent of jobs in Australia have a high probability
of being susceptible to computerisation and automation in the next 10 to 15
years. Jobs in administration and some services are particularly susceptible,
as are regions that have historically associated with the mining industry. Jobs
in the professions, in technical and creative industries, and in personal
service areas (health for example) are least susceptible to automation. The
report can be found <a href="http://adminpanel.ceda.com.au/FOLDERS/Service/Files/Documents/26792~Futureworkforce_June2015.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Nonparametric Bayesian Inverse&nbsp;Problems</h3>
<div class="col-sm-6 col-md-6" style="margin-left: -15px;">
<div class="panel panel-default">

        <img src="/images/ugp-sign.png" alt="UGP signum test">

    <div class="panel-footer">
        Example of learning the unscented Gaussian process (<span class="caps">UGP</span>) with a
        non-differentiable nonlinear function (forward model) in the likelihood
        - a polynomial with one term in a signum function. Here only the black
        dots are seen by the algorithm, and the nonlinear function transforming
        the blue line to the green is known, but not its inverse. The aim is to
        estimate the latent function (blue line) from the black dots, without
        knowing the inverse function. In this figure we show the predictive
        distributions of the latent function (red dashed line and standard
        deviation bounds) and of the observations (green line and standard
        deviation bounds).
    </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Nonlinear inversion problems, where we wish to infer the latent inputs to a
system given observations of its output and the system’s forward-model, have a
long history in the natural sciences, dynamical modeling and estimation. An
example is the robot-arm inverse kinematics problem, where we wish to infer how
to drive the robot’s joints (i.e. joint torques) in order to place the
end-effector in a particular position, given we can measure its position and
know the forward kinematics of the arm. Most of the existing algorithms either
estimate the system inputs at a particular point in time like the
Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, or in a recursive manner such as the extended
and unscented Kalman filters (<span class="caps">EKF</span>, <span class="caps">UKF</span>). In many inversion problems we have a
continuous process; a smooth trajectory of a robot arm for example.
Non-parametric regression techniques like Gaussian processes seem applicable,
and have been used in linear inversion&nbsp;problems. </p>
<p>In this work we present two new methods for inference in Gaussian process (<span class="caps">GP</span>)
models with general nonlinear likelihoods. Inference is based on a variational
framework where a Gaussian posterior is assumed and the likelihood is
linearized about the variational posterior mean using either a Taylor series
expansion or statistical linearization. We show that the parameter updates
obtained by these algorithms are equivalent to the state update equations in
the iterative extended and unscented Kalman filters respectively, hence we
refer to our algorithms as extended and unscented GPs. The unscented <span class="caps">GP</span> treats
the likelihood as a &#8216;black-box&#8217; by not requiring its derivative for inference,
so it also applies to non-differentiable likelihood models. We evaluate the
performance of our algorithms on a number of synthetic inversion problems and a
binary classification dataset. See our <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5455-extended-and-unscented-gaussian-processes"><span class="caps">NIPS</span> <em>spotlight</em>

<h3>Unsupervised Scene&nbsp;&#8220;Understanding&#8221;</h3>

            cluster. 
        </div>
    </div>
    </div>
</div>

<p>For very large scientific datasets with many image classes and objects,
producing the ground-truth data for supervised (trained) algorithms can
represent a substantial, and potentially expensive, human effort. In these
situations there is scope for the use of unsupervised approaches, such as
clustering, which can model collections of images and automatically summarise
their content without human&nbsp;training. </p>
<p>To explore how modelling context effects clustering results, I derived several
new algorithms that simultaneously cluster images and segments (super-pixels)
within images. These algorithms also model collections of photos such as photo
albums. Images are defined by whole-scene descriptors <em>and</em> the distribution of
&#8220;objects&#8221; (segment clusters) within them. The images and segments are clustered
using this joint representation, which is also more interpretable by people.
The intuition behind this approach is that by knowing something about the type
of scene (image cluster), object detection (segment clustering) can be
improved. That is, we are likely to find trees in a forest. Additionally, by
knowing about the distribution and co-occurrence of objects in an image, we
have a better idea of the type of scene (cows and grass most likely make a
rural&nbsp;scene). </p>
<p>These algorithms for unsupervised scene understanding outperform other
unsupervised algorithms for segment and scene clustering. This is because of
how they model context. These algorithms were even found to be competitive with
state of the art supervised and semi-supervised approaches to scene
understanding, as well as being scalable to larger datasets. See
my <a href="/docs/Steinberg_ICCV2013_MCM.pdf"><span class="caps">ICCV</span> paper</a>,
<a href="/docs/CVIU_scene.pdf"><span class="caps">CVIU</span> article</a> and my <a href="/docs/Thesis.pdf">thesis (ch. 5 <span class="amp">&amp;</span>
6)</a> for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<div style="clear: both"></div>

<h3>Clustering Images Over Many&nbsp;Datasets</h3>
<p>Large image collections are frequently partitioned into distinct but related
groups, such as photo albums from distinct environments that contain similar
scenes. For example, a hiking holiday album may contain many images of forests
and maybe a few villages. Whereas a conference trip album may have many urban
scenes and images of people, with perhaps a few images of park-land. These
groups, or albums, may be thought of as providing context for the images they&nbsp;contain.</p>
<p>I have formulated and applied a latent Dirichlet allocation-like algorithm to
this problem. It shares image clusters between groups or albums, and keeps the
proportion of clusters (mixture-weights) specific to each group, thereby
modelling the context of the group. By doing this, the algorithm is actually
better at finding clusters, and is often faster when dealing with large
datasets, than regular mixture model based approaches. See my 
<a href="/docs/Thesis.pdf">thesis (ch.4)</a> for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<div class="panel panel-default">
    <div class="panel-body">
        <img src="/images/halbums_gmc_sub.jpg" alt="Album clusters">
    </div>
    <div class="panel-footer">
        Here 10,300 images from 12 holiday photo albums are clustered. Shown
        are the most and least &#8220;likely&#8221; images from seven clusters (out of 23).
        Also shown are the most frequent five tags from Flickr associated with
        the clusters. The algorithms that could model these photo albums found
        more self-consistent clusters than the algorithms that count not, such
        as regular mixture models. This took less than a minute to run. Again,
        these are entirely unsupervised algorithms

<h3>Clustering Images of the&nbsp;Seafloor</h3>
<p>I have applied a Bayesian non-parametric algorithm, the variational Dirichlet
process (with Gaussian clusters), to clustering large quantities of seafloor
imagery (obtained from an autonomous underwater vehicle or <span class="caps">AUV</span>) in an
unsupervised manner. The algorithm has the attractive property that it does not
require knowledge of the number of clusters to be specified, which enables
truly autonomous sensor data abstraction. The underlying image representation
uses descriptors for colour, texture and 3D structure that are obtained from
stereo cameras. This approach consistently produces easily recognisable
clusters that approximately correspond to different habitat types.  These
clusters are useful in observing spatial patterns, focusing expert analysis on
subsets of seafloor imagery, aiding mission planning, and potentially informing
real time adaptive sampling. See my

            belonging to each of the 6 clusters found by the algorithm are
            shown row-wise. The algorithm used only took a few seconds to
            obtain these results, and needed no human generated training data.
            That is, the algorithm found these image clusters with no human
